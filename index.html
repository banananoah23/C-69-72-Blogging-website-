                    first, we had to start driveing at 4:30 AM so there was no traffic
                    then, after like 6-8 hours, we new we would not make it all the way to canada
                    next, we searched up a few close hotels, and we found one. We did this for 2 days.
                    finally, we arrived at Monteal, and we met my cousans and styed at teair house for a week, then left.

Our elementary students partake in hands-on activities that require them to develop solutions to real-world problems using LEGO bricks and engineering fundamentals.
